# utils
This is a collection of utility scripts I've written, with some help of course. Hopefully they'll prove to be useful to other people.

## Setup
- Clone this repo somewhere
- Add the scripts in `/bin` to your `$PATH`
- Enjoy!

**NOTE:** You may have to modify some utils for your specific use-cases, such as the `svnmerge` script. I'll work on making that specific script more dynamic eventually.
